There's got to be more than just 3 creatures to fight with, right? Correct! By buying and hatching eggs, you can create new creatures to raise them as your own.
So let's do a quick rundown of the egg window, shall we?

### Egg Supply

The egg supply represents how many eggs are available on the contract for purchase. When it runs out, you cannot purchase that type of egg anymore, until it's refilled again.

### Your Eggs

This is where your eggs will be shown, and also where you can buy some more, by clicking the... you guessed it, the "Buy" button!

Once you have an egg, you can hatch it! Just click on the "Hatch" button and watch it go!
As soon as the timer runs out, you can open that egg, and see what kind of pet you got!
