So is that it? I just hatch pets and watch them grow?
Well, no! You can fight with other players, of course!

There's a bit to unpack here, so let's go through it by order!

Right at the top there, you can see yourself where I marked (YOU)

Right under that, you can see another rank player, you can see its trophy right next to its name (1.)

Next to the trophy, you can see the player's rank (2.)

Rank is increased/decreased at the end of matches, whenever you win or lose one.

On the right of the players, you can see their loadout, in other words, the last 3 pets they used to fight! You can even check the name of the pets by hovering them (3.)

Finally, at the top, you can switch between the global ladder (4.) and the clash ladder (5.)
