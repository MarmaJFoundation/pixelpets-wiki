To get started, you will want to add some pixel tokens. To do that, simply click that "+" button right next to your account name.
Following that, you can swap Near for some PXT on our website. But fear not! If you cannot do that yet, you can still continue.

### Your pets

This is where you will find all the pets you have! You always start with these 3, so you can check out how the game works.
Speaking of which, let's try and do that, shall we?

## Fighting
Select your 3 pets on the right by either right clicking them, or pressing the "Select Pet" button.

Once they're all selected, just press the "Search Match" button and wait a little bit!

### Combat System
The combat is automatic, and the way it works is very simple. 
Each player attacks within the order of their creatures in crescent order. 
Being Pet #1 the first attacker on each side, and up to Pet #3. 
This sequence loops until one of the players has lost all of his pets in combat and the winner is decided.

You can speed up the fight by clicking the buttons on the bottom!
At the end of the match, each pet gets 50 experience, and pets that fainted will be injured for a period that is equivalent to its level.
You also get or lose some ranking, depending if you've won!

Now, what exactly decides who won? Let's look at the stats each pet has, shall we?
To do so, simply click in one of your pets on the right tab!

Once in here, you can see your pet stats, but there's not a lot of info about them, so, let me tell you how each one works.

### Level

The level of the pet. Each level increases the stats of the pet by 2%. Also the injured duration raises with each level.
You can also check the progress of the level on the exp bar right next to it.

### Training Level
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12151584/135688447-3a45899c-b319-4f7b-b3f1-33cb81f826d6.png)

It's possible to raise the training level of the creature to level 10. Each training raises the pet stats by 2%.

### Powerlevel

The powerlevel is a random number between 30 and 100 and affects the stats of the pet based on it's value. 30 decreases the stats by 20%, 100 increases the stats by 60%.

### Attack Type
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12151584/135700952-e0707a19-edc8-484d-807a-7847c04d0799.png)

## Some other information

### Fighting Points

Allowance are points used whenever you make a server call. If you stay too long in the game, it will run out and you'll have to re-login in order to fill it up again.

## Eggs & More Eggs!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12151584/135701260-7dec7217-a49c-49fe-b19a-28af1767ea5c.png)

There's got to be more than just 3 creatures to fight with, right? Correct! By buying and hatching eggs, you can create new creatures to raise them as your own.
So let's do a quick rundown of the egg window, shall we?

### Egg Supply
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12151584/135701306-f35117d9-8d5d-4274-ad7e-c2ba526508c5.png)

The egg supply represents how many eggs are available in the server for purchase. When it runs out, you cannot purchase that type of egg anymore, until it's refilled again.

### Your Eggs

This is where your eggs will be shown, and also where you can buy some more, by clicking the... you guessed it, the "Buy" button!

### Hatching Eggs

Once you have an egg, you can hatch it! Just click on the "Hatch" button and watch it go!
As soon as the timer runs out, you can open that egg, and see what kind of pet you got!
