Okay, but what if I don't want to wait for an egg to hatch? Well, that's why we have the market!

Once in there, it's very straight forward, just click the pet you want and choose which offer you like the best!
You can sort them out by price, level, power level and other stats you wish!

Once you have chosen your favorite offer, you can buy them and they will be yours!

In order to sell your pets, you have to do it from the main screen. Simply click on your pets and input a price that you wish to sell it for.

Once selling, your pet cannot do anything else. You can stop selling it at any time.
